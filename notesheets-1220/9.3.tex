  Suppose a country's population \(P(t)\) at time \(t\) is modeled
  by \[
    \frac{dP}{dt} = 2P+10
  \]
  Find an expression for \(P(t)\) if \(P(0)=1,000,000\).
\end{ex}
\begin{ex}
  Suppose that the population \(Q(t)\) of fruit flies in a controlled
  in a controlled environment is increasing by the rule \[
    \frac{dQ}{dt} = kQ(500-Q)
  \]
  If the initial population is \(10\) and it grows to \(100\) after
  \(2\) days, find the population after \(10\) days.

  Solve the IVP \[
    \frac{dx}{dt} = k(L-x), x(0)=x_0
  \]
  where \(k,L,x_0\) are constant and \(x = x(t)\) is a function in \(t\).

\begin{ex}
  A tank contains \(20\)kg of salt dissolved in \(5000\)L of
  water. Brine that contains \(0.03\)kg of salt per liter of water
  enters the tank a ta rate of \(25\)L/min. The solution is kept
  thoroughly mixed and drains from the tank at the same rate. How much
  salt remains in the tank after half an hour?
