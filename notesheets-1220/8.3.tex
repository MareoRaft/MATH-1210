\begin{defi}
  Let \(f(x,y)\) be a function defined on a region \(R\) containing
  the point \((a,b)\). Then,
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \(f\) has a \de{relative maximum at \((a,b)\)} with
    \de{relative maximum value} \(f(a,b)\) if \\
    
  \item \(f\) has a \de{relative minimum at \((a,b)\)} with
    \de{relative minumum value} \(f(a,b)\) if\\
    
  \item \(f\) has an \de{absolute maximum at \((a,b)\)} with
    \de{absolute maximum value} \(f(a,b)\) if\\
    
  \item \(f\) has an \de{absolute minimum at \((a,b)\)} with
    \de{absolute minimum value} \(f(a,b)\)if
  \end{itemize}
\end{defi}
\begin{thrm}
  If \(f(x,y)\) is a differentiable function of two variables and has
  a relative maximum (relative minimum) at a point \((a,b)\) in the
  domain of \(f\), then

\begin{ex}
  Consider the function \(f(x,y) = (1-x^2) \sin(y)\). Compute the
  following
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item \(f_x(0,0), f_y(0,0)\) and \(f_x(1,0),f_y(1,0)\).
    \vspace{0.75in}
  \item \(f_{xx}(0,0), f_{xy}(0,0), \) and \(f_{yy}(0,0)\)
    \vspace{0.75in}
  \item \(f_{xx}(1,0), f_{xy}(1,0),\) and \(f_{yy}(1,0)\)
  \end{enumerate}
\end{ex}

\begin{thrm}[The Second Derivative Test]
  Let \(f(x,y)\) be a twice differentiable function with continuous
  second derivatives. Let \[
    D(a,b) = f_{xx}(a,b)f_{yy}(a,b) - [f_{xy}(a,b)]^2
  \]
  If \(f_x = 0\) and \(f_y = 0\),
  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
  \item \(D(a,b) > 0\) and \(f_{xx}(a,b) < 0\), then
    \vspace{0.075in}
  \item \(D(a,b) > 0\) and \(f_{xx}(a,b) > 0\), then
    \vspace{0.075in}
  \item \(D(a,b) < 0\), then
    \vspace{0.075in}
  \item \(D(a,b) = 0\), then
  \end{enumerate}
