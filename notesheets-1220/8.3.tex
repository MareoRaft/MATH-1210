\begin{defi}
  Let \(f(x,y)\) be a function defined on a region \(R\) containing
  the point \((a,b)\). Then,
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \(f\) has a \de{relative maximum at \((a,b)\)} with
    \de{relative maximum value} \(f(a,b)\) if \\
    
  \item \(f\) has a \de{relative minimum at \((a,b)\)} with
    \de{relative minumum value} \(f(a,b)\) if\\
    
  \item \(f\) has an \de{absolute maximum at \((a,b)\)} with
    \de{absolute maximum value} \(f(a,b)\) if\\
    
  \item \(f\) has an \de{absolute minimum at \((a,b)\)} with
    \de{absolute minimum value} \(f(a,b)\) if
  \end{itemize}
\end{defi}
\begin{ex}
  Consider the function \(f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2\). Does this function
  have any relative minima? Relative maxima? What is
  \(f_x(0,0)\) and \(f_y(0,0)\)?
\end{ex}
\begin{thrm}
  If \(f(x,y)\) is a differentiable function of two variables and has
  a relative maximum (relative minimum) at a point \((a,b)\) in the
  domain of \(f\), then
