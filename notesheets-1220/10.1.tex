\begin{rmk}
  Recall that the probability of an event \(E\) occurring (such as
  getting a \epsdice{2} on a \(6\)-sided die) is given by \[
    P(E) = \hspace{2in}
  \]
  What is the probability of rolling an odd number on a \(6\)-sided
  die?

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item The \de{sample space} \(S\) of an experiement is
  \item An \de{event} is
    \vspace{0.5in}
  \item A \de{random variable} (RV) \(X\) is a \\ \vspace{0.3in}\\
    and it is called \de{continuous} if \\
    and \de{discrete} if
    \vspace{1in}
  \item A \de{probability density function} (PDF) of a random variable
    \(X\) in an 
    interval \(I\) is a function \(f(x)\) such that

\begin{ex}
  Are the following functions valid PDFs?
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item For rolling a \(6\)-sided die, let \(f(t) = \frac{1}{6}\) for
    \(t=1,\ldots,6\).
    \vspace{0.3in}
  \item For rolling a \(6\)-sided die, let \(f(6)=1\) and \(f(t)=0\)
    for all other \(t\).
    \vspace{0.3in}
  \item \(S = [0,1]\). Let \(f(x)=x\).
    \vspace{0.3in}
  \item \(S = [0,1]\). Let \(f(x) = \frac{e^x}{e-1}\).
    \vspace{0.3in}

\begin{ex}
  Find the value of \(k\) such that \(f(x) = k e^{-x}\) over \(S =
  [0,\infty)\) is a PDF.
\end{ex}
\begin{defi}
  Let \([a,b] \subset I\), the interval for a continuous random
  variable \(X\). Then, the event \(E = ``a \leq X \leq b\)''
  has probability \[
    P(a \leq X \leq b) = \hspace{2in}
  \]
\end{defi}
\begin{ex}
  \(f(x) = \frac{1}{9} x^2\) on \([0,3]\) is a PDF. Evaluate the
  following probabilities
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item \(P(1 \leq X \leq 3)\)
  \item \(P(1 \leq X)\)
  \item \(P(X=1)\)
  \item \(P(x < 1)\)
  \end{enumerate}
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
  The life expectancy (in years) of a TV is a continuous RV with
  PDF \[
    f(t) = \frac{1}{2}e^{-\frac{t}{2}}, \ \ (0 \leq t < \infty)
  \]
  Find the probability that a randomly chosen TV will last more than
  \(2\) years. (This distribution is called an \de{exponential density
  function}.)
