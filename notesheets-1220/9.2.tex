\begin{defi}
  A \de{separable} differential equations is a differential equation
  that can be written in the form \[
    \frac{dy}{dx} = 
  \]
\end{defi}
\begin{thrm}
  To solve a separable differential equation, we solve \[
    \int \frac{dy}{g(y)} = \int f(x)\dx
  \]
\end{thrm}
\begin{ex}
  Solve the following differential equations using the method of
  separation of variables
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item \(y'=xy^2\)
    \vspace{2in}
  \item \(y' = \frac{6x^2}{2y+\cos(y)}\)
    \vspace{2in}
  \item \(y'=\frac{y}{x}\)
    \vspace{2in}
  \item \(y' = \frac{xy}{x^2+1}, y(0)=1\)
  \end{enumerate}
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
  A radio active isotype has initial mass \(100\)g. It decays at a
  rate proportional to its current mass and \(5\) years later, its
  mass is \(60\)g.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Find an expression giving \(Q(t)\), that is, the amount of the
    isotope (in grams) after \(t\) years.
  \item Find the half-life of this isotype, ie, find \(T\) such that
    \(Q(T) = \frac{1}{2}Q(0)\).
  \end{enumerate}
\end{ex}
