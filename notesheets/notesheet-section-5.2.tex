  We define \(y = \log_b x\) to be the number such that

\begin{ex}
  What are the following logarithms? Try to justify your answer from
  the definition of \(\log_b x\) above.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item \(\log_b m + \log_b n\)
  \item \(\log_b m - \log_b n\)
  \item \(n \log_b m\)
  \item \(\log_b 1\)
  \item \(\log_b b\)
  \end{enumerate}

  Remembering theorem \(5\) on notesheet \(5.1\), can you figure
  out the following properties of \(f(x) = \log_b x\)?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Its domain is
  \item Its range is
  \item Its graph always passes through the point
  \item It is continuous on
  \item If \(b > 1\), then it is increasing on \hspace{1in}. If
    \(b<1\), it is decreasing on \hspace{1in}.
  \end{itemize}

\begin{ex}
  \(f(x) = \log_e x = \ln x\) is called the \de{natural logarithm} and is the
  inverse function to \(g(x) = e^x\). In other words, for all \(x\) in
  the appropriate domain \((f \circ g)(x) = x\) and \((g \circ f)(x) =
  x\). Can you graph the equation \(f(x) = \ln(x)\)?

  Write each of the following expressions as the logarithm of a single
  quantity
