\begin{thrm}[Properties of Definite Integrals]
  Let \(f\) and \(g\) be integrable functions. Then,
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item \(\int_a^a f(x) \dx = \)
  \item \(\int_a^b f(x) \dx = \)
  \item \(\int_a^b k f(x) \dx = \)
  \item \(\int_a^b [f(x) \pm g(x)] \dx = \)
  \item \(\int_a^b f(x) \dx + \int_b^c f(x) \dx = \)
  \end{enumerate}
\end{thrm}
\begin{ex}
  Evaluate \[
    \int_0^4 \sqrt{2x+1} \dx
  \]
  by first finding \(\int \sqrt{2x+1} \dx\) and then applying the
  Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
\end{ex}
\begin{thrm}[Substitution for Definite Integrals]
  If \(g'\) is continuous on \([a,b]\) and \(f\) is continuous on the
  range of \(g(x)\), then \[
    \int_a^b f(g(x))g'(x) \dx = \int
  \]
\end{thrm}
\begin{ex}
  Find the area under the graph of \(f(x) = 8xe^{x^2}\) on the
  interval \([0,2]\).
\end{ex}
\begin{ex}
  If \(f\) is continuous and \(\int_0^4 f(x) \dx = 10\), find
  \(\int_0^2 f(2x) \dx\). If \(g\) is continuous and \(\int_0^9 g(x)
  \dx = 4\), find \(\int_0^3 xg(x^2) \dx\).
\end{ex}
\begin{thrm}
  Given a function \(f\) that is integrable on \([a,b]\), the
  \de{average value} of \(f\) over \([a,b]\) is
  \vspace{0.2in}
\end{thrm}
\begin{ex}
	The height of the water in Swan Lake is measured periodically over the course of a year.  The height $h(t)$ in inches as a function of time $t$ in weeks is modelled by
	$$ h(t) = 40 + \frac{1}{(t+1)^2}.$$
	What is the average height of the lake water that year?
