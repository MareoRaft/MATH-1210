\begin{defi}
  An \de{antiderivative} of a function $f$ is some other function $F$ such that
\end{defi}
\vspace{-0.65in}
\begin{ex}
  If $f(x) = x^2 - \frac{1}{5}x + 1$, show that $F(x) = \frac{1}{3}x^3 - \frac{1}{10}x^2 + x$ is an antiderivative of $f$.  If $g(x) = x^3 - x + 4$, find an antiderivative $G$ of $g$.
\end{ex}
\vspace{-0.8in}
\begin{thrm}
  If $G$ is an antiderivative of $f$, then every antiderivative $F$ of $f$ is of the form

  What are antidifferentiation, integration, integral sign, indefinite integral, integrand, and the constant of integration?

\begin{ex}
  The velocity of a train at time $t$ is $v(t) = 9t$.  What is the velocity at time 0?  What is the acceleration of the train as a function of time?  What is the position of the train as a function of time, given that the position at time 0 is 0?  (The final question is an ``initial value problem''.)
