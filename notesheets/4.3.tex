\begin{defi}
	The line $x=a$ is a \de{vertical asymptote} of the function $f$ if one of the following is true:
\end{defi}
\begin{ex}
	Let $f(x) = \frac{x^2}{x^2 - 16}$.  Can you find all (if any) vertical asymptotes of $f$?  Sketch $f$.
\end{ex}
\begin{ex}
	Let $f$ be a rational function (recall that $f(x) = \frac{p(x)}{q(x)}$ where the numerator and denominator are polynomials).  What must happen to $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ at a point $a$ in order for $f$ to have a vertical asymptote $x=a$?
\end{ex}

\begin{defi}
	The line $y=b$ is a \de{horizontal asymptote} of the function $f$ if one of the following is true:
\end{defi}
\begin{ex}
	Let $g(x) = 2 + \frac{1}{x^3}$.  Can you find all (if any)
        horizontal asymptotes of $g$?  Find all (if any) vertical
        asymptotes of $g$.  Sketch $g$. Hint: \(2^{-\frac{1}{3}}
        \approx 0.79\).
\end{ex}
\begin{ex}
	Sketch the graph of the function $f(x) = \frac{x^2 - x}{x^2 -
          4}$. Hint: \(\sqrt{3} \approx 1.73\).
\end{ex}
\begin{ex}
	Sketch the graph of the function $f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$.  Identify the horizontal and vertical asymptotes.  Identify any concavity.
\end{ex}
