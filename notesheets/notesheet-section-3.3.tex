  Recall the chain rule, which says \[
    \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{du} \frac{du}{dx}
  \]
  or, alternatively \[
    \frac{d}{dx}[(f \circ g)(x)] = f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x).
  \]
\end{thrm}

\begin{ex}
  Using the chain rule, compute the derivative of \(f(x) =
  (1-x)^2\). Make sure it agrees with the answer when you expand
  \((1-x)^2\). Also make sure it agrees with the product rule when
  thinking of \(f(x) = g(x)h(x)\) with \(g(x) = (1-x) = h(x)\).
\end{ex}
\begin{ex}
  If \(F(x) = f(g(x))\) where \(f(-2) = 8\), \(f'(-2) = 4\), \(f'(5) =
  3\), \(g(5)=-2\), and \(g'(5) = 6\), find \(F'(5)\).
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
  What is the derivative of \(f(x) = (2x-5)^4 (8x^2-5)^{-2}\)?
\end{ex}
\begin{ex}
  Find an equation for the tangent line to the curve \(y =
  \frac{|x|}{\sqrt{2-x^2}}\) at \((1,1)\).
\end{ex}
\begin{ex}
  Find the points on the graph of \(f(x) = \frac{1}{3}(x^2-9)(x-3)\) where the tangent line is
  horizontal.
\end{ex}
\begin{ex}
  A manufacturer produces colts of fabric with a fixed width. The
  quantity \(q\) of this fabric (in yards) that is sold is a function
  of the selling price \(p\) (in dollars per yard), so we can write
  \(q = f(p)\). Then, the total revenue earned with selling price
  \(p\) is \(R(p) = pf(p)\).
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item What does it mean to say that \(f(20) = 10,000\) and \(f'(20)
    = -350\)?
  \item Assuming the values in part (a), find \(R'(20)\) and interpret
    your answer.
  \end{enumerate}
