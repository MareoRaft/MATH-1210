\begin{ex}
  We have learned how to solve basic integrals. What about more
  complicated ones? Can you solve this more complicated integral? \[
    \int 2x \sqrt{1+x^2} \dx
  \]
  Remember, you need only find a function \(F(x)\) such that \(F'(x) =
  2x \sqrt{1+x^2}\). (Hint: think about the chain rule for derivatives.)
\end{ex}
\begin{thrm}
  Let \(F\) and \(g\) be differentiable functions. If \(F'\) is
  continuous on the range of \(g\), then \[
    \int F'(g(x))g'(x) \dx =
  \]
\end{thrm}

\begin{ex}
  Compute the following indefinite integrals using substitution.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item \(\int \sqrt{2x+1} \dx\) (Hint: substitute \(u=2x+1\))
    \vspace{1in}
  \item \(\int \frac{x}{\sqrt{1-4x^2}} \dx\)
    \vspace{1in}
  \item \(\int e^{5x} \dx\)
  \end{enumerate}
\end{ex}
\begin{ex}
  The registrar of a university estimates that total student
  enrollment in the Continuing Education division will grow at the
  rate of \[
    N'(t) = 2000(1+0.2t)^{-\frac{3}{2}}
    \text{ students/year}
  \]
  \(t\) years from now. If the current student enrollment is \(1000\),
  find an expression giving the total student enrollment \(t\) years
  from now. What will student enrollment be \(5\) years from now?
\end{ex}
\begin{ex}
  Find \(\int \frac{(\ln x)^2}{x} \dx\)
\end{ex}
% \begin{ex}
%   Consider the definite integral \[
%     \int_0^2 2 x^3 \dx
%   \]
%   Evaluate it. Now, substitute \(u = x^2, du = 2x \dx\) and evaluate
%   this integral. Must you change the bounds of integration to get the
%   correct answer?
% \end{ex}
% \begin{thrm}
%   If \(g'\) is continuous on \([a,b]\) and \(f\) is continuous on the
%   range of \(u = g(x)\), then \[
%     \int_a^b f(g(x))g'(x) \dx =
%   \]
