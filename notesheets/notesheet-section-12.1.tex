\begin{defi}
  What is an \emph{angle}?  What are the \emph{initial ray}, \emph{terminal ray}, and \emph{vertex} associated with the angle?
\end{defi}
\vs\vs
\begin{ex}
  For each drawing, identify the angle $\theta$ in degrees.  Then create your own drawing for the angles $\alpha = 180^\deg$ and $\beta = -1^\deg$.

    \item \includegraphics[scale=0.10]{images/angle-1}
    \item \includegraphics[scale=0.10]{images/angle-2}
    \item \includegraphics[scale=0.10]{images/angle-3}
    \item \includegraphics[scale=0.10]{images/angle-4}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{ex}
\begin{defi}
  What is the \emph{unit circle} and what are \emph{radians}?
\end{defi}
\vs\vs
\begin{ex}
  For the previous challenge, write down each angle in radians.  Then create your own drawing for the angles $\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}$, $\phi = -\pi$, and $\psi = 1$.

\begin{ex}
  Can you convert the angles $\alpha = 0^\deg$, $\beta = 270^\deg$, and $\gamma = -60^\deg$ into radians?  Can you convert the angles $\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}$, $\phi = -\pi$, and $\psi = 1$ into degrees?
