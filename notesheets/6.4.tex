\begin{thrm}[Fundamental Theorem of Calculus]
  If $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$, then
  $$\int_a^b f(x) \dx = \hphantom{F(b) - F(a)}$$
  where $F$ is any antiderivative of $f$.
\end{thrm}
\begin{ex}
  If $R$ is the region under the graph of $f(x) = 2x$ on the interval $[1, 5]$, then find the area of $R$ two different ways.
\end{ex}
\begin{ex}
  Consider the curve $y = -x^2 + 9$.  What is the area of the region bounded by the curve and the $x$-axis?
\end{ex}
\pagebreak
\begin{ex}[Negative area]
  Consider again the curve $y = -x^2 + 9$.  Compute $A = \int_{-3}^{5} (-x^2 + 9) \dx$.  Can you shade the region whose area is $A$?
\end{ex}
\begin{ex}
  The population of Calculusville grows at a rate of $900t^2 - 2{,}000t + 2{,}500$ people per month, where $t$ is the number of months since November of $2017$.  What will be the net change in the population of Calculusville from January $2018$ to February $2018$.?
\end{ex}
\begin{ex}
  Evaluate $$\int_2^3 \left(x^{-3} + x^{-1}\right) \dx.$$
