\begin{defi}
	\de{function} is
\end{defi}
\begin{defi}
	(\de{domain}, \de{range})
\end{defi}
\begin{ex}
	Let $f$ be the function defined by $f(x) = 6x^2 - 8$.  What is
        $f(3)$?  What is $f(a+b)$? What is the range of \(f\) when the
        domain is \(\R\)?
\end{ex}
\begin{defi}
	What is the Cartesian coordinate system, origin, $x$-axis, $y$-axis, ordered pair, $x$-coordinate, $y$-coordinate, Quadrants I, II, III, and IV?

\begin{defi}[Distance formula]

\end{defi}
\begin{ex}
	Find the distance between the points $(3, 2)$ and $(8, -10)$.
\end{ex}
\begin{ex}
	Let $C$ be a circle with center $(1,4)$ and radius $7$.  Write an equation that defines all points $(x,y)$ that lie on the boundary of the circle.  (Note that every point on the boundary of the circle must satisfy this equation.)
\end{ex}
\begin{ex}
	Consider a straight shoreline with a station $S$ at point
        $(8{,}000, 0)$ and a cable that runs to point $Q = (2{,}000,
        0)$ (on land) and then runs underwater to point $M = (0, 5{,}000)$.
        Cable on land costs $\$3$ per foot and underwater costs $\$6$
        per foot.  What is the cost of the cable? (Useful fact:
        \(\sqrt{29} \approx 5.385\).)
