\begin{defi}
  Given the functions $f$ and $g$, what are the \de{sum}, \de{difference}, \de{product}, and \de{quotient} functions of $f$ and $g$?  What are the domains of these functions (given that the domain of $f$ is $A$ and the domain of $g$ is $B$)?
\end{defi}
\begin{ex}
  Let $f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 1$ and $g(x) = x$.  What are the sum, difference, product, and quotient functions?
\end{ex}
\begin{ex}
  Let $j(x) = \sqrt{x - 1}$ and $k(x) = x - 3$.  What is the domain of the product function $jk$?  What is the domain of the quotient function $j/k$?  (Hint: Start by identifying the domain of $j$ and the domain of $k$, each as a subset of the real numbers $\R$)

\begin{defi}
  Given the functions $f$ and $g$, what is the \de{composition} function $g \of f$?  What is the domain of this function?
\end{defi}
\begin{ex}
  Let $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$ and $g(x) = x^2 - 1$.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item What is the composition $g \of f$?  What is the domain?
    \item What is the composition $f \of g$?  What is the domain?
  \end{enumerate}

\begin{ex}
  An environmental impact study for city $Y$ indicates that under existing environmental protection laws, the level of carbon monoxide (CO) present in the air due to automobile exhaust will be $0.01x^{2/3}$ parts per million when the number automobiles is $x$ thousand.  A separate study conducted by the government estimates that $t$ years from now, the number of automobiles in city $Y$ will be $200t^2 + 4{,}000t + 64{,}000$.

  What is the concentration of CO in the air from automobiles $t$ years from now?  (As a function of $t$)
