This repository is for the University of Virginia MATH-1210 (Survey of Calculus I) course.  This repository was created by the instructors Matthew Lancellotti and George Seelinger, but other instructors are welcome to use it if they wish.  The repository contains content for our students.

We house content primarily as .tex files, and we automatically generate the corresponding .pdf files which appear in the RELEASES tab above.  Students should visit the RELEASES tab and retrieve notes, worksheets, etc from there.
