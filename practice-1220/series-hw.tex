  Do the following series converge? Justify your answer. (Hint: all of
  these series appear on older class materials. You can probably guess
  which methods to use based on their placement.) [Tip: you may want
  more space to answer some of these; manage space strategically!]
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item \(\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^n}\)
    \vspace{1in}
  \item \(\sum_{n=1}^\infty \tan(n)\)
    \vspace{1in}
  \item \(\sum_{n=0}^\infty n e^{-n^2}\)
    \vspace{1in}
  \item \(\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{2}{n^e}\)

  \item \(\sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{5}{n^{1/3}-1}\)
